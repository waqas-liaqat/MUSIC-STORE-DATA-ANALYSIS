# üéµ Music Store Data Analysis using PostgreSQL

This project showcases my SQL skills through an in-depth analysis of a music store dataset using PostgreSQL. I performed data analysis tasks that range from simple queries to advanced data insights, focusing on customer behaviors, sales performance, and music preferences.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, I answered various business-related questions grouped into three levels of difficulty: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced. Each question aims to solve specific business needs by querying the music store's database, which contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and genres.

## üí° Key Analysis & SQL Queries

### **Question Set 1 - Easy:**
1. **Senior Most Employee**: Query to find the senior-most employee based on job title.
2. **Countries with Most Invoices**: Determine which countries generated the highest number of invoices.
3. **Top 3 Invoice Totals**: Retrieve the top three highest invoice totals.
4. **Best Customer City**: Identify the city where the store made the most revenue, ideal for a promotional music festival.
5. **Top Spending Customer**: Find the customer who has spent the most money on purchases.

### **Question Set 2 - Moderate:**
1. **Rock Music Listeners**: Return the email, first name, last name, and genre of all Rock music listeners, ordered alphabetically by email.
2. **Top 10 Rock Bands**: List the top 10 artists who have produced the most Rock tracks.
3. **Tracks Longer than Average**: Return all tracks that are longer than the average song length, ordered by song length.

### **Question Set 3 - Advanced:**
1. **Customer Spending on Artists**: Find how much each customer spent on each artist, returning the customer name, artist name, and total amount spent.
2. **Popular Genre by Country**: Identify the most popular music genre for each country based on the highest number of purchases.
3. **Top Spending Customer by Country**: Determine the customer who spent the most money in each country, with special handling for ties.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: To run SQL queries and perform analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying, filtering, aggregating, and analyzing the data.

## üèÜ Key Takeaways
This project highlights:
- My ability to write efficient SQL queries to solve real-world business problems.
- Use of advanced SQL concepts like joins, aggregations, and subqueries to gain deeper insights from data.
- Providing actionable insights for decision-making based on the analysis results.
